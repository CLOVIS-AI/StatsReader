# StatsReader
A little software for visualizing arrays of data.

This program was created for my Stepper project, but designed to be as reusable as I can with my current knowledge.

It uses Processing and Java.

Java 7+ might be required.

This project was first announced on my blog https://clovis-cyclone.blogspot.fr/search/label/StatsReader
